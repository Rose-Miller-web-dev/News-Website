Hi! I'm glad that you are here to inspect my work samples
Take these steps to run this code : 
0> Install Angular
1> Open VS code
2> Go to file -> open foulder and select the foulder you would like to run
3> Go to terminal -> open terminal
4> Type the exact command of npm run start
you need to wait a couple of minutes if it is the first time you are running the code

BTW. If it is too time taking for you to install Angular or run this code you can easily take a look at the mockups I have put in the main foulder. They are screenshots I have taken from my code running on browser.
BTW#2. I'm always available on email or Upwork chats, so keep in touch

Let's go for our amazing co-operation!

Rose Miller
